On Bonnie Purser's machine in Austin at Joey's where we've just fixed it not booting.
    I installed PyCharm and calGOut and in just a few minutes had
    calGOut running with tkinter and

setup.py might be needed to install all the requirements in the VirtualEnvironment.
    If not dateutil.tz then run setup.py to get everything?
    sudo pip install python-dateutil --upgrade
    sudo pip install pytz --upgrade

    requirements.txt contains everything I need for PyCharm to install.

Shifting from command-line date strings to calculated last-2-weeks date strings is failing.
    Figure out how to get last-2-weeks into command-line acceptible format.

Make main.py run it.
Change tkinter options page to have key fields.
